<h1>peace as a woman</h1>
<p>Peace you see is woman of vision that goes through the thick and thin to visualize a vision.
    the road down there might not be as sweet as we thought, but we keep race going so in the end we can all say, Truly, Slow and steady wins the race.
 </p>
 <p>Peace is a woman worth looking up to,courageous and bold in times of adversity.she picks up every opportunity life throws at her and utilize it.
    All this is just an insight of who peace is.
    Thanks.
